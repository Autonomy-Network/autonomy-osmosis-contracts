          ## About limits/stops wrapper:
          This proposal aims to deploy the necessary code on-chain for a wrapper contract around the Osmosis DEX that, when used with the Autonomy Registry (deployed in a simultaneous proposal with this one), adds the ability to do limits and stops on Osmosis.
