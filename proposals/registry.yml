        ## Summary

        The **Registry** has successfully gone through testnet and is now ready to launch onto the Osmosis mainnet.

        Vote **YES** on this proposal if you want the bytecodes of registry contract (as part of Autonomy Network) to be put onto Osmosis.
        Vote **NO** on this proposal if you do not want the bytecodes of registry contract (as part of Autonomy Network) to go on chain.

        ## About Autonomy Registry:
        This proposal aims to deploy the necessary code on-chain to deploy Autonomy Network as a base system to automate any on-chain action with any on-chain condition. Things are generally automated by using the Autonomy Registry in conjunction with a wrapper contract around some system - for example like a wrapper around the Osmosis DEX that allows for limits and stops on Osmosis. A 2nd simultaneous proposal will deploy this wrapper contract to add limits and stops to Osmosis.
